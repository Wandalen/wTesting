# Running tests

How to run single file testing and group testing.

### Downloading

The [`Tools`](<https://github.com/Wandalen/wTools>) module has a ready test suites. Use them see how the framework works. Clone the repository of the module by executing the `git clone https://github.com/Wandalen/wTools.git` command.

```

</details>

The module code, along with its tests, is located in the `proto` directory.

After cloning, go to the module directory and enter the command

```
npm install
```

It installs module dependencies.

To get information about available test suites, enter the command

```
tst .suites.list
```

10 test suites
```

</details>

According to the output, the `Tools` module has 10 test suites. In other words, it is 10 files as every single test file is assigned to the test suite. Eight of them are in `proto/wtools/abase/l1.test`, one in `proto/wtools/abase/l2.test` and one in `sample` directory.

### Testing one test suite

The testing is performed by executing the `JavaScript` file with the test suite.

Enter the command:

```
node proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s
```

As a result, the test will be performed, and a report will be displayed.

$ node proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s

</details>

The test unit of the suite `Long.test.s` is the` _.array*` and `_.buffer*` routines for handling arrays and buffers.

The report shows that all tests were successful: `Test suite (Tools/base/l1/Long) ... in 41.251s ... ok`. The test was completed in 42 seconds, and 173 test routines were run. During the testing, 4293 test checks were made, which were grouped by the developer in the 1891 test cases. The detail of the report depends on [the verbose level](Verbosity.md).

Duration of the first test routine `bufferFrom` is 0.358 seconds, and according to the report, it, like the rest, was passed. The passed tests in the report indicate green. Failed tests indicate red. It's enough one failed test check to consider the entire test suite has failed.

The second way is to use the `tst` command. Enter the command
```
tst .run proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s
```

<details>
  <summary><u>Command output <code>tst .run proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s</code></u></summary>

$ tst .run proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s

</details>

Read the command as: find and run all tests in the `proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s` directory. Compare the resulting output with the previous one. The last test report is similar to the previous. The difference in time, which can range from run to run

### Comparison of command input

So, you can run the test suite by launching the 'JavaScript' file by the interpreter. To do this, after the interpreter command, type a path to the file as an argument
```
node File.test.js
```
or enter this path as an utility argument
```
tst .run File.test.js
```

### Testing one test routine

The test suite is divided into test routines that run sequentially or concurrently and independently of each other. Testing a whole test suite is not always appropriate - it takes more time than testing one test routine.

To run a separate test routine, use the `routine` option.

```
node path/to/TestSuite.js routine:someRoutine
```
or

```
tst .imply routine:someRoutine .run path/to/TestSuite.js
```

This command will run the test routine `someRoutine`  of the test suite `TestSuite.js`.

Running the test with the name of the desired test routine in the `routine` option restricts the testing to the specified test routine. The rest of the test routines do not run. The `routine` option has a shortened entry form - `r`. Also, the option can accept glob instead of full name of routine.

Run the `bufferFrom` routine of ` Long.test.s` test suite. To run the test, enter the command

```
tst .imply routine:bufferFrom .run proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s
```

<details>
  <summary><u>Command output <code>tst .imply routine:bufferFrom .run proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s</code></u></summary>

```
$ tst .imply routine:bufferFrom .run proto/wtools/abase/l1.test/Long.test.s

```

</details>

The report shows that only one `bufferFrom` test routine was tested. As part of this routine test, 18th test checks were successfully passed in 18 test cases.

### Group testing

Testing a set of test suites requires [globally installed](Installation.md) utility `Testing`. To run the tests specify the directory with the test files after entering `tst .run`.

Run the test in the `proto` directory by entering the command

```
tst .run proto
```

<details>
  <summary><u>Command output <code>tst .run proto</code></u></summary>

```
$ tst .run proto

</details>

Each test suite in the `./proto` directory, the utility has tested in turn. The report is displayed as it is ready.

A general summary of the tests is given in the last line: `Testing ... in 75.676s ... ok`. It indicates that all test suites were successful and the test was completed in 76 seconds.

To [get a list](Help.md) of test suites in the directory, use the command

```
tst .suites.list
```

### Summary

- To run the tests, use the `tst .run ./Suite.test.js` command or the `node ./Suite.test.js` command.
- It is possible to run a separate test suite, a separate test routine, or a set of test suites in the directory.
- To test a set of files, you need to install the `Testing` utility globally.
- Information about failed tests helps to find errors in the code of test unit.
